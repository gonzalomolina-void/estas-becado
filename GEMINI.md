## Project Overview

This project is a static website prototype for a university graphic design course. The website, titled "¿Estás Becado?" (Are you on a scholarship?), is designed to help students find scholarships. The prototype consists of three main pages: a home page, a page for available scholarships, and a search page.

The project is built using HTML and CSS, with some JavaScript for a dark mode toggle and icons from the Lucide icon library. The code is not bundled or minified, and there are no build tools used.

## Key Files

The main files for the prototype are the "v2" HTML files, which represent the most recent version of the design:

*   `estas_becado_home_v2.html`: The home page of the website.
*   `estas_becado_becas_disponibles_v2.html`: A page that displays a grid of available scholarships and includes a form to filter them.
*   `estas_becado_busqueda_v2.html`: A page with a search interface for scholarships, including filters and a results table.

The older "v1" files and the directories `home`, `busqueda`, and `becas_disponibles` appear to be from an earlier iteration of the prototype and can likely be ignored.

## Usage

To view the prototype, open the "v2" HTML files in a web browser. For example, to see the home page, open `estas_becado_home_v2.html`. The pages are linked together, so you can navigate between them.
